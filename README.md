# monotype_tape_reader

Mechanical parts for reading paper tape created by Monotype keyboard.


## TODO

### 2021-09-27: Revisions to first prototype

- [x] Stiffen camera support area of baseplate so it doesn't flex with weight of phone.  Propose to extend plate both sides of reader bar.

- [x] Camera support bracket:  make space for nuts on the threaded rod (move holes away from vertical side)

- [x] Camera support bracket: increase width of base.

- [x] positive location/keying for reader bar.

- [x] Increase M4 hole size

- [x] Arrangement to prevent phone holder rotating on bar.  Also improve phone positioning.

- [x] Countersink for winder crank screw; review crank design to ensure pulley groove is clear of turning crank

- [x] Option to remove winder so that tape can be loaded/unloaded.

- [x] tape tensioning arrangement.  Guides to wrap tape around reader bar?

- [x] slot in winder shaft for catching tape (?)  C-clip over shaft?

- [x] Clamp to attach reader mechanism to a solid baseplate.

- [x] Larger gaps and guide rods for reader bar


### 2022-08-19: revisions to Mk2

(see Journal/20220819-MC-journal-reader-mk2.md)

[x] Redesign the tape-path guides to use guide sprockets.

[x] Include a small raised inner hub on the support brackets for the tape spools.

[x] Make the tape spools wider (more excess over width of the tape)

[x] Use a spoked design for the tape spools (less plastic, print time and weight).

[x] Replace axle for tape spools with a plastic locking arrangement, so they are more easily separated to remove the tape.

[x] Redesign the tape clips to slip on and off the winder spools, and with a lip to stop them spinning


### 2022-10-02: revisions to Mk2.5

[ ] Clip wider flange

[ ] Storage clip more clearance, no break.  This to allow it to slide off.

[ ] Stiffer baseplate (8 -> 12mm edge height?)

[ ] Additional mount and foot for winder/stepper (front edge)

[ ] Winder separate from reader bridge (drive belt stresses structure)

[ ] Captive nut holders in baseplate

[ ] Shorten the tape path?

[ ] Make the baseplate wider (doesn't seem necessary?)


[x] Sprocket pins larger (why are they so small?)
