### 2021-09-27: Revisions to first prototype

- [x] Stiffen camera support area of baseplate so it doesn't flex with weight of phone.  Propose to extend plate both sides of reader bar.

- [x] Camera support bracket:  make space for nuts on the threaded rod (move holes away from vertical side)

- [x] Camera support bracket: increase width of base.

- [x] positive location/keying for reader bar.

- [x] Increase M4 hole size

- [x] Arrangement to prevent phone holder rotating on bar.  Also improve phone positioning.

- [x] Countersink for winder crank screw; review crank design to ensure pulley groove is clear of turning crank

- [x] Option to remove winder so that tape can be loaded/unloaded.

- [x] tape tensioning arrangement.  Guides to wrap tape around reader bar?

- [x] slot in winder shaft for catching tape (?)  C-clip over shaft?

- [ ] Clamp to attach reader mechanism to a solid baseplate.

- [ ] Larger gaps and guide rods for reader bar
