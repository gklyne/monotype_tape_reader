Some notes on the typesetting process

Clarice's diary was hand written in an exercise book during the period 1915-16.  This printed version has been produced using the Monotype system, the process for typesetting that would have been used in her lifetime.

The Monotype system consists of two machines: a keyboard and a caster which communicate by means of a spool of punched paper tape.  The keyboard produces the spool containing encoded text and layout information.  The caster reads the punched code and, line by line, produces pages of justified type cast from molten lead using a matrix.  The chosen typeface, in this case Bulmer 11pt, is determined by the matrix containing a grid of character moulds.

This entirely mechanical system revolutionised book production during the early 20th century.
The use of punched paper tape was an idea ahead of its time, which reappeared later in digital computers.
It was offset and digitised production processes built around these computers that were to eventually replace the Monotype system in the latter half of the century.

Monotype is a rare system that is now hard to find in use.  Stan Lane of Gloucester Typesetting Services has been using this process for over 40 years, and is now passing the mantle to Katie Beard of Rooksmoor Press.  Their knowledge and expertise are what has made production of this book possible.
